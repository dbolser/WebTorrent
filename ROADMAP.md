- [ ] Create basic WebSocket bridge to local I2P SAM interface
- [ ] Document browser security limitations and workarounds

**Week 3-4: WebTorrent + I2P Bridge**
- [ ] Fork WebTorrent to add I2P transport layer
- [ ] Implement SAMv3 connection handling in browser
- [ ] Create I2P peer discovery mechanism
- [ ] Test basic peer connection through I2P network
- [ ] Handle WebRTC signaling over I2P tunnels

### Month 2: Basic Client

**Week 5-6: Hybrid Transport System**
- [ ] Implement dual-mode: I2P discovery + WebRTC transfer
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms (I2P-only vs clearnet-only modes)
- [ ] Add peer reputation tracking
- [ ] Implement basic certificate accumulation for seeding
- [ ] Create simple web UI for manual torrent addition

**Week 7-8: Testing & Optimization**
- [ ] Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking I2P vs direct connections
- [ ] Connection reliability testing with various I2P configurations
- [ ] Security audit of browser-I2P integration
- [ ] Documentation for manual setup and testing

**Deliverable:** Working proof-of-concept that can download/seed torrents through I2P network in browser

**Week 11-12: Smart Caching System**
- [ ] Predictive content downloading based on trends
- [ ] User preference learning (favorite shows, topics)
- [ ] Bandwidth-aware download scheduling
- [ ] Cross-user coordination to avoid duplicate caching
- [ ] Content verification and integrity checks

### Month 4: User Experience

**Week 13-14: Certificate & Reputation System**
- [ ] Seeding credit calculation algorithms
- [ ] Certificate earning mechanics (time seeding, bandwidth provided)
- [ ] Premium content access tiers
- [ ] Anti-gaming measures (Sybil resistance, verification)
- [ ] Certificate marketplace/exchange system

**Week 15-16: Automated UI/UX**
- [ ] Zero-config onboarding flow
- [ ] Background operation indicators
- [ ] Bandwidth usage controls and monitoring
- [ ] Content recommendation engine
- [ ] Progress tracking and achievement system

**Deliverable:** Self-managing podcast distribution network with user incentives

## Phase 3: Network Effects (Months 5-6)

### Month 5: Advanced Networking

**Week 17-18: Multi-Browser Coordination**
- [ ] Distributed hash table for content discovery
- [ ] Cross-browser communication protocols
- [ ] Load balancing across browser instances
- [ ] Redundancy and failover mechanisms
- [ ] Network topology optimization

**Week 19-20: Advanced Seeding Algorithms**
- [ ] Geographic distribution optimization
- [ ] Time-zone aware seeding schedules
- [ ] Bandwidth-based peer selection
- [ ] Content rarity prioritization
- [ ] Network health monitoring and reporting

### Month 6: Community & Analytics

**Week 21-22: Community Features**
- [ ] User leaderboards and competitions
- [ ] Podcast creator integration tools
- [ ] Community voting on content priority
- [ ] Social features (following, sharing, recommendations)
- [ ] Creator tipping/support mechanisms

**Week 23-24: Analytics & Launch Prep**
- [ ] Privacy-preserving analytics dashboard
- [ ] Network health metrics and alerts
- [ ] Performance optimization based on usage patterns
- [ ] Security hardening and penetration testing
- [ ] Launch marketing materials and documentation

**Deliverable:** Production-ready platform with active community features

- **Throughput:** 80% of direct WebRTC speeds after initial discovery
- **Reliability:** 95% successful peer connections
- **Resource Usage:** <100MB RAM, <10% CPU when idle
- **Network Contribution:** >1GB/day seeding per active user

### Security Milestones
- **Anonymity:** No IP address leakage through I2P integration
- **Integrity:** Cryptographic verification of all content
- **Privacy:** Zero persistent tracking of user behavior
- **Resilience:** Graceful degradation under network attacks
- **Compliance:** GDPR/privacy regulation adherence
